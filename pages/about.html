        <p class="about">Inspired by our two golden retrievers, Ginger and Paris, our cozy breakfast spot is a haven for dog lovers and breakfast enthusiasts alike. From classic favorites like Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Waffles to our veggie-friendly All Around Veggie Pancake Platter, each dish is crafted with care and canine-inspired charm.</p>
        <p class="about">Our dog-friendly space welcomes furry friends indoors and outdoors, so you can enjoy your meal in the company of your best pal. Plus, a portion of our proceeds goes towards supporting local animal shelters, because every dog deserves a loving home.</p>
